Marutukku (my cryptographic file system/block device) is due for first
beta sometime next week. Before release, I'd like some (strong!)
criticism of the sub key generation / chaining techniques I'm
using. But first, for those who haven't a frigging clue what Marutukku
is, here is a hastily drawn non-cryptographic (more about that later)
features list:

	o OS independent (excepting two files pertaining only to the
          kernel drivers)

	o Currently implemented as a 4.4bsd (Free/Net/OpenBSD)
	  loadable kernel module, and client (I have someone working
          on the Linux port, but no promises).

	o The BSD implementation turns a file (even an NFS mounted
	  file) into a device, on which any number of file systems
          types can be created in the regular manner (or even a swap
          partition ;)

	o Endian independent - Marutukku extents (the ciphertext
	  regions) can be mailed around like .tar files

	o various backup/recovery/whole extent encryption/decrypt
	  functions built into the client

Marutukku supports a variety of ciphers, and the cipher used for the
lattice (which is used to generate sub-keys for each file-system
block) generation is independent from the cipher used for block
functions. At the moment it only makes sense to talk of the lattice
generator in terms of a stream cipher or a block cipher/hash algorithm
in OFB. My design principles along the way have attempted as far as
possible to cover as yet unknown vulnerabilities in the under-laying
ciphers used with good management of IV's, salts, sub-keys, chaining
etc.  Some of these steps may pose no additional security in relation
to certain attacks (i.e secret vs public IV's) on particular ciphers
but most come at little cost compared to the encryption itself.

Primary key/salt generation walk though:

	A pass-phrase of size (l) is requested from the
	user. max_keysize (256) public random key saltation bytes are
	generated and [saved]. (l) of these bytes then salt the key
	(XOR) (we don't use more than (l) to avoid any potential
	issues with key-correlation attacks as the salt is public).

	max_keysize cryptographically random bytes are produced to
	form the "master key".

	The salted pass-phrase is used to encrypt the master key,
	which is [saved].

	The (unencrypted) master key is used to key a stream cipher
	(in this case that's rc4 or rc16) which is used for further
	key generation.

	Bytes [0] and [1] of the key stream output are saved for later
	use in creating a pass-phrase checksum (more about that later).

	Bytes [2] and [3] of the key stream are saved for later use in
	encrypting the number of stream-cipher key-generator
	iterations.

	The stream cipher is then set to stir its internal state for
	(t) seconds (a user supplied value). The number of iterations
	(i) is counted, the two LSBytes's from which are encrypted
	with [2] and [3] and [saved]. The reason we don't encrypt the
	MSB's is that they are are likely to be known-plain-text (all
	0 bits to the left) which can be used for key-scanning checks.
	This has the annoying effect of reducing the uncertainty in
	the iteration count to 2^16, but I can't fathom a way around
	it without exposing bits of the stream output.

	Stream bytes [3+i] and [3+i+1] are XOR-ed with bytes [0] and
	[1] to provide a 16 bit key checksum and [saved]. The distance
	here serves to obfuscate any predictability in the key-stream
	generator and force the attacker though all (i) iterations to
	test each key (or if they are attacking directly on the
	internal state of the stream cipher at (i) to generate guesses
	at [0] as well).
	
	Public random key-salt for the two primary lattice keys is
	generated and [saved].

	n * 2 (n=32 for a 4G file-system-block maru extent) public
	random sub-key lattice IV's are generated and [saved].

	The public master block IV array salt is randomly generated
	and [saved].

Instance/Lattice generation:

	The saved maru saltation/IV header (above) is loaded, and the the
	pass-phrase is salted as before. The master key is decrypted
	and the key stream cipher is initialised, half the checksum is
	generated, the number of iterations decrypted, the generator
	stired, the other half of the checksum is generated and the
	checksum verified.

	The two primary lattice salts are encrypted with the key
	stream stream and form the primary lattice keys for the
	lattice fs-block sub-key generating block cipher.

	The n*2 lattice sub-key IV's are encrypted with the stream and
	form the lattice sub key array.

	The master block IV salt array is encrypted with the stream
	and forms the master block IV array.

	This ends the primary initialisation stage.

Block key generation:

	The problem here is to turn a block number into a unique
	"sub-key" for each fs-block in such a way that frustrates
	possible key (or other) correlation attacks. i.e discovering
	the key for one block should not help the cryptanalyst in
	discovering the key for any other block. It is simple to
	generate a sub-key key-stream with a stream cipher or a block
	cipher operating in OFB, but storing such a construct is
	untenable and it is not efficient to generate on the fly (for
	instance, the first fs-block accessed might be the last in the
	maru extent, which would correlate to the last sub-key
	generated by the key-stream).  The solution designed and
	employed is a binary tree based key generation approach, that
	can generate a cryptographically-unique block key in
	log2(max_blocks) steps. The author has thought of various
	variations on this scheme (e.g with two different
	cryptographic hashes, one moving left, one moving right), but
	see below for the variant used in Marutukku.
	
	It is simpler to visualise the sub-key generator tree "turned
	inside out" as a 2d lattice, two columns across and n rows
	down (this is also how it is implemented in Marutukku). i.e

		______________________
		|LEFT	   |     RIGHT|
		|----------+----------|
		|L-SUBKEY 0|L-SUBKEY 1|
		|----------+----------|
		|L-SUBKEY 1|L-SUBKEY 2|
		|----------+----------|
		|   ....   |   ....   |
		|----------+----------|
		|L-SUBKEY n|L-SUBKEY n|
		|__________|__________|


	The journey from fs-block number to fs-block-key starts with
	the msb of the block number and the top of the lattice (we use
	the msb rather than the lsb for caching reasons. Using the lsb
	naively seems more secure but uncacheable, yet on closer
	examination, neither of theses claims are true (however the
	Marutukku lattice sub-key cache *performance* using lsb is
	poor due to the inverted clustering)). As each bit slides off
	the left of the block number, key material is picked up from
	the left or right of the lattice according to whether the bit
	is on or off. Each lattice sub-key chosen is encrypted with
	the next (CBC wise, but lattice sub-key size, rather than
	cipher block size) at the top of the lattice and twines it's
	way down to the end, collecting key-material as it goes. The
	result is a unique compressed (i.e its the CBC chaining
	performing the compression) "necklace" of key material which
	forms the appropriate fs-block key.

FS block encryption:

	Each plain text block in the fs-block is XOR-ed with the
	corresponding entry in the master block IV array and then CBC
	encrypted. In effect, each cipher block has two IV's. The
	first block, which lacks any cipher text from previous blocks
	to chain with, uses the block number XOR-ed with its master
	block IV entry.

	The rational behind this is that we have the benefits of CBC's
	error-recovering abilities without it's major drawback (and it
	is certainly not alone here among major block cipher
	modes) - that is, find the key for (cipher) block 0 and the
	attacker can successfully decrypt every other block that (CBC
	wise) follows it.
